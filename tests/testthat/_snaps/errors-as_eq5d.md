# as_eq5d errors correctly

    Unable to allocate a `time_index` column. Attempted to use '.time_index' as a variable name but this was already present in `x`. Please explicitly state a value for `time_index` or rename '.time_index'

    `surveyID` has been converted to an ordered factor with default levels equivalent to `sort(unique(surveyID))`.
