This vignette will show a way to analyse EQ-5D data using statistical models. The goal is to calculate the utility values, based on longitudinal EQ-5D data, identify explanatory variables and calculate the QALY loss. As a basis we use the survey included in the package. The survey includes the age of the participants. For the analysis we group the participants by age ($[20,40), [40,60), [60,+)$). This is common practice in this field, because health outcomes are generally highly dependent on the age of the participants.

```{r thedata}
library(surveyTools)
dat <- surveyTools::EQ5D5L_surveys |>
  dplyr::mutate(surveyID = factor(surveyID)) |>
  # Split population into age groups
  dplyr::mutate(AgeGroup = cut(age, c(20, 40, 60, Inf), right = F))

dat |>
  dplyr::select(respondentID, surveyID, mobility, self_care,
                usual, pain, anxiety, AgeGroup, sex) |>
  dplyr::arrange(surveyID, respondentID) |>
  head() |>
  knitr::kable(caption = "Data excerpt")
```

Next we calculate the utility values based on the EQ-5D survey.

```{r loaddata}
input_dat <- as_eq5d5l(
    dat,
    mobility = "mobility",
    self_care = "self_care",
    usual = "usual",
    pain = "pain",
    anxiety = "anxiety",
    respondentID = "respondentID",
    surveyID = "surveyID",
    time_index = "time_index",
    vas = "vas"
) |>
  add_utility(dat, type = "DSU", country = "UK", age = "age", sex = "sex")
```

We will be using a mixed effect model to fit to the data. The model is defined as `value ~ (1 + acute | respondentID) + surveyID + sex + AgeGroup + sex:AgeGroup`. This means that we assume each respondent to have a random effect as well as a random interaction between the first survey after symptoms (acute). Other explanatory variables are the survey, sex and age group (and the interaction between sex and age group). This model was chosen based on our knowledge of the data. For your own dataset it is recommended to choose your own model. For example, by exploring multiple models and choosing the best model (using standard model comparison methods).

To fit our mixed effect model we use the `lme4` package. While the utility value is truncated at 1, it has been shown that assuming a normal distribution and performing a non parametric bootstrap is a valid simplification [@pull_analysis_2010]. We will explore a more complex approach later in this vignette.

```{r lmerModel, fig.cap = "Comparing the modelled utility values with the utility values in the model. Utility values were calculated from a EQ5D5L survey using the DSU method."}
# Label the acute period of the disease
input_dat |>
  dplyr::mutate(acute = surveyID == "survey02") -> dat

# Define the model
model <- .value ~ (1 + acute | respondentID) +
  surveyID + sex + AgeGroup + sex:AgeGroup
lme4::lmer(model, data = dat) -> fit2

# Compare predictions to the actual value
dat |>
  dplyr::mutate(Model = predict(fit2)) |>
  dplyr::rename(Actual = .value) |>
  tidyr::gather(type, value, Actual, Model) -> plot_dat

ggplot(plot_dat) +
  geom_line(aes(x = surveyID, y = value, group = respondentID, colour = sex),
            alpha = 0.1) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ type)
```

The get estimates of the uncertainty around the model we rely on a non parametric bootstrap. For this bootstrap we resample (with replacement) from our respondents and fit the model to the resampled data.

```{r bootstrap}
set.seed(1)
# Using 100 samples for illustrative purposes.
# For full analysis you should use >1000
nboot <- 100

dat |>
  dplyr::select(respondentID) |>
  dplyr::distinct() -> respondents_dat

seq(1, nboot) |>
  purrr::map(purrr::quietly(function(np_id) {
    # Sample the respondents to include in this bootstrap and
    # give them an unique id (boot_respondent_id)
    respondents_dat |>
      dplyr::sample_n(nboot, replace = T) |>
      dplyr::mutate(boot_respondent_id = dplyr::row_number()) |>
      dplyr::left_join(dat, by = "respondentID") -> boot_dat

    lme4::lmer(.value ~ (1 + acute | boot_respondent_id) + surveyID + sex +
               AgeGroup + sex:AgeGroup, data = boot_dat) -> fit
    list(model = fit, np = as.numeric(np_id), data = boot_dat)
})) |> 
  purrr::keep(function(lst0) length(lst0$warnings) == 0) -> models
```

Using the bootstrapped models we can generate a figure with the explanatory variables. This shows that (as expected) survey 2 had the worst outcomes. Survey 3, 4 and 5 also had significantly worse outcomes than survey 1, but respondents returned to base line levels of health from survey 6 onwards. We did not find a significant correlation between age and sex with their utility values, except for 60 and over year old males, who experienced lower utility than the other groups.

```{r coefficients, fig.cap = "Coefficients of the statistical model. Uncertainty was captured by fitting the model to bootstrapped data. The blue colour highlights coefficients that were significant."}
# Gather coefficients from the bootstrapped models
models |> purrr::imap(function(model, np_id) {
    summary(model$result$model)$coefficients |>
      tibble::as_tibble(rownames = "id") |>
      dplyr::mutate(np = np_id)
    }) |>
  dplyr::bind_rows() -> coeff_dat

coeff_dat |>
  dplyr::group_by(id) |>
  dplyr::summarise(quant = c(0.025, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.975),
                   value = quantile(Estimate, quant),
                   Significant = all(value < 0) || all(value > 0)
                   ) |>
  dplyr::ungroup() |>
  tidyr::spread(quant, value) |>
  # Cleanup names of the coefficients
  dplyr::mutate(idname = stringr::str_replace(id, "(sex|surveyID)", "")) |>
  dplyr::filter(idname != "(Intercept)") -> plot_dat


ggplot(data = plot_dat) +
  geom_linerange(aes(x = idname, ymin = `0.025`, ymax = `0.975`,
                     colour = Significant), size = 1) +
  geom_linerange(aes(x = idname, ymin = `0.25`, ymax = `0.75`,
                     colour = Significant), size = 2) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1),
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "none")
```

Finally, we use the model to generate utility values and calculate the QALY loss by age group. QALY loss compared to full health does increase with age, but when compared to the baseline health (survey 1) it stayed relatively stable.

```{r qaly}
# Calculate the QALY values for the different bootstrapped models
models |>
  purrr::imap(function(lst0, np_id) {
  lst0$result$data |>
    dplyr::mutate(pvalue = predict(lst0$result$model)) |>
    # Convert to utility
    surveyTools::new_utility(respondentID = "boot_respondent_id",
                             surveyID = "surveyID",
                             time_index = "time_index",
                             country = ".utility_country",
                             type = ".utility_type",
                             value = "pvalue") |>
    surveyTools::validate_utility() |>
    # Calculate the qaly for based on the utility values
    surveyTools::calculate_qalys(baseline_survey = "survey01") |>
    dplyr::mutate(np = as.numeric(np_id)) |>
    dplyr::left_join(lst0$result$data |>
                     dplyr::select(boot_respondent_id, AgeGroup, sex) |>
                     dplyr::distinct(), by = "boot_respondent_id")
}) |> dplyr::bind_rows() -> qaly_dat
```

```{r qalyFig, fig.cap = "QALY values based on the model. The cross is the mean QALY based on the data. The uncertainty represents the uncertainty in the mean QALY loss according to the model"}
qaly_dat |>
  dplyr::group_by(.qaly, AgeGroup, np) |>
  dplyr::summarise(value = mean(.value)) |>

  dplyr::summarise(quant = c(0.025, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.975),

  dplyr::ungroup() -> dat0

ggplot(data = plot_dat) +
  geom_linerange(aes(x = AgeGroup, ymin = `0.025`, ymax = `0.975`,
                     colour = .qaly, group = .qaly),
                 position = position_dodge2(0.5)) +

                 size = 2) +
  geom_point(data = dat0, aes(x = AgeGroup, y = mean, group = .qaly),
                 position = position_dodge2(0.5), size = 3,
                 shape = 4) +
  expand_limits(y = 0)
```

## Using a Bayesian approach with a hurdle model

The analysis above makes the simplifying assumption that utility values are normally distributed. While it has been shown that this assumption tends to lead to similar results as more complex models, here we wanted to show a method that does not make that assumption. This method relies on the `brms` package to fit the model. The `brms` package uses a Bayesian approach, so an additional benefit of this approach is that the bootstrap is not needed anymore. A downside is that fitting such a model takes a lot longer, which also makes it more costly to run a model comparison.

To fit the model we convert the utility value to a value that ranges 0 and above ($x = 1 - \text{utility}$) and we assume that the converted value follows a hurdle gamma distribution. The hurdle is needed, because in health data many people tend to report full health (utility value of 1). A full explanation of hurdle models is outside the scope of this vignette, but some good discussion can be found [here](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2022/05/09/hurdle-lognormal-gaussian-brms/).

```{r brmsanalysis}
# Use multiple cores for brms
options(mc.cores = 4)
library(brms)
input_dat |>
  dplyr::mutate(acute = surveyID == "survey02", x = 1 - .value) -> dat

brm(bf(x ~ (1 + acute | respondentID) + surveyID + sex + AgeGroup +
       sex:AgeGroup,
# For simplicitely we use the same explanatory variables for the hurdle
# except for the age sex interaction
       hu ~ (1 + acute | respondentID) + surveyID + sex + AgeGroup),
    data = dat, family = hurdle_gamma(), iter = 750) -> hbrm_model

# Draw posterior samples to use in qaly calculation
brms::posterior_predict(hbrm_model, ndraws = 1000, newdata = dat) ->
  posterior_dat

# For each posterior sample, calculate the qaly loss
purrr::map(seq_len(nrow(posterior_dat)), function(np_id) {
  dat |> dplyr::mutate(pvalue = 1 - posterior_dat[as.numeric(np_id), ]) |>
    surveyTools::new_utility(respondentID = "respondentID",
                             surveyID = "surveyID",
                             time_index = "time_index",
                             country = ".utility_country",
                             type = ".utility_type",
                             value = "pvalue") |>
    surveyTools::validate_utility() |>
    surveyTools::calculate_qalys(baseline_survey = "survey01") |>
    dplyr::mutate(np = as.numeric(np_id))
}) |> dplyr::bind_rows() |>
    dplyr::left_join(dat |>
      dplyr::select(respondentID, AgeGroup, sex) |>
      dplyr::distinct()) -> qaly_dat
```

```{r hurdleModel, fig.cap = "Comparing the modelled utility values, using the hurdle model, with the utility values in the model. Utility values were calculated from a EQ5D5L survey using the DSU method."}
# For comparison, plot posterior using one posterior sample
dat |> dplyr::mutate(pvalue = 1 - posterior_dat[1, ]) |>
  surveyTools::new_utility(respondentID = "respondentID",
                           surveyID = "surveyID",
                           time_index = "time_index",
                           country = ".utility_country",
                           type = ".utility_type",
                           value = "pvalue") |>
  surveyTools::validate_utility() -> dat0

dat0 |>
  dplyr::rename(Actual = .value, Model = pvalue) |>
  tidyr::gather(type, value, Actual, Model) -> plot_dat

ggplot(plot_dat) +
  geom_line(aes(x = surveyID, y = value, group = respondentID,
                colour = sex), alpha = 0.1) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ type)
```

Next, we look at the coefficients for this model. The results also include the coefficients for the hurdle (hu) part of the model, but those are not significant. Similar to previous results survey 2 had the worst outcomes. Survey 3, 4 and 5 also had significantly worse outcomes than survey 1, but respondents returned to base line levels of health from survey 6 onwards. In contrast, to the simpler model this analysis does find find a significant correlation between age and sex with their utility values, which might be due to the increased power of this model. Note that because we transformed our utility variable, the sign of these are the opposite of the previous results.

```{r coefficientsHurdle, fig.cap = "Coefficients of hurdle model. Uncertainty was captured by fitting the model to bootstrapped data. The blue colour highlights coefficients that were significant. Note that because we transformed our utility variable, the sign of these are the opposite of the previous results."}
